The README should be more explicative to the user about how to use your code, not focused on the technical details of the implementation.
It should explain:
    - which lines to edit in the Makefile and how (which paths to insert)
    - how to edit the code in order to choose among the different methods
    - how to pass the data using the json file.

Code organization:
    I would have expected an include folder with the header files of the classes

Quality of the code:
    It was a good idea to implement classes containing the parameters and the solve methods.
    The code is clear and well commented.

    Why do you initialize result as a copy of the initial guess if you don't use it?
    You could also avoid the for loops for setting the coordinates and use copy assignment.
